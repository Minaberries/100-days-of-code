# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 16, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Began & Completed "Basic HTML and HTML5" offered through freecodecamp.org.
**Thoughts:** Tomorrow I want to spend some more time creating a static page utilizing what I have learned in this curriculum to test my knowledge and to see if I retained the information well. It's been a several years since I really excercised the all the fundamentals of HTML & HTML 5.

### Day 1: April 17, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Began & Completed "Basic CSS" offered through freecodecamp.org.
**Thoughts:** As I progressed through the curriculum, it really reminded me of the spentless hours in my room after high school on Xanga & Myspace creating templates for the community. I really enjoyed going through the past two courses. I strugged a bit with Absolute vs Relative Units but I was able to retain some of the information I learned yesterday in some of the lessons I encoutered which made myself very proud. I can't wait until I can write and create pages of my own from scratch.

### Day 2: April 19, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Began & still in the progress of completing "Applied Visual Design" of offered through freecodecamp.org. I stopped this evening around "Use a CSS Linear Gradient to Create a Striped Element" portiion. 
**Thoughts:** There were some portions within this objective where I thought way too hard about and it ended up being solved by a simple tag. This might be because I started my 1 hour session a bit later this evening and missed yesterdays (shame on me) and my brain is a little fried but I forced my self to get online and do it. I still need to get my head to fully wrap around releative and absolute terminology.
