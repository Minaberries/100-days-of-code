### Day 0: April 16, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Began & Completed "Basic HTML and HTML5" offered through freecodecamp.org.
**Thoughts:** Tomorrow I want to spend some more time creating a static page utilizing what I have learned in this curriculum to test my knowledge and to see if I retained the information well. It's been a several years since I really excercised the all the fundamentals of HTML & HTML 5.

**Link to work:** N/A
